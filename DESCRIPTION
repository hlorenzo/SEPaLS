Description: R package to compute Shrinkage for Extreme Partial Least-Squares 
    (SEPaLS) estimators, an adaptation of the original Partial Least Squares 
    (PLS) method tailored to the extreme-value framework.
    The SEPaLS project is a joint work by Stephane Girard, Hadrien Lorenzo and 
    Julyan Arbel.
    R code to replicate the results of the paper is available at 
    <https://github.com/hlorenzo/SEPaLS_simus>.
    Extremes within PLS was already studied by one of the authors, see M 
    Bousebeta, G Enjolras, S Girard (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2022.105101>.
